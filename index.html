            <p>
                What is known about Trevor's background comes from his own words. Trevor was born and raised in Canada,
                near the border with the United States, or, as he calls it, the "Canadian border region of America". In
                a conversation with Franklin while hanging out, he claims he "grew up in five states, two countries,
                fourteen different homes, eight fathers, three care homes, two correctional facilities, one beautiful,
                damaged flower of a mother" and has "served time, my country, your country and myself.
